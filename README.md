Project Overview
Title:
Heartbreaks and Art Blocks 
Story:
Heartbreaks and Artblocks  follows the story of a young couple who have an argument in a restaurant. Unbeknownst to them, a young artist is observing their confrontation, drawing inspiration for her next art piece. The narrative unfolds through the distinct perspectives of two women: one is the girl in the troubled relationship, and the other is the artist witnessing the scene. The story explores how one man's sorrow becomes the other's source of creative joy, ultimately connecting two seemingly unrelated individuals through shared experiences.
The primary aim of the project is to create a dramatic, yet subtle, narrative that invites the audience to engage with the unfolding events from multiple viewpoints. By offering these two perspectives, the film encourages viewers to empathize with both characters, challenging their assumptions and deepening their emotional connection to the story.

The Creative Process
Concept Development:
The initial concept was inspired by Taylor Swift's song "Right Where You Left Me", in which a young woman is left devastated by a breakup in a restaurant. The song’s melancholic tone and themes of isolation were a strong influence on the project's direction. We set a rough plan in a restaurant, with the couple's breakup serving as the emotional core of the story.
The original plan was to shoot in either Blacksmith Coffee Cafe or Marketplace at NYU Abu Dhabi, with a preference for Marketplace due to its more manageable lighting and sound conditions. After further brainstorming, Anastasia proposed a compelling twist: introducing a third character, a young artist who finds inspiration in the couple’s argument. This character would use the moment to overcome her artist's block and create a beautiful artwork.
To deepen the narrative, Liya suggested we present the story from two different perspectives: the perspective of the young woman in the breakup and that of the observing artist. This dual-point-of-view structure would allow the audience to explore the same event through contrasting lenses, fostering a deeper understanding of the emotional nuances involved.
Planning:
Initially, we settled on Marketplace as our filming location. The cast included Ahmed and Anastasia as the young couple, and Liya as the artist. Sabrina handled camera and audio work, and took the role of director. 
Unexpectedly, due to a private event being held at Marketplace, we were forced to find an alternative location. The team adapted quickly and relocated to Boba Bae, another café, where we were able to complete the shoot. Some shots required multiple takes, but the team’s collaborative spirit ensured we met our creative vision.

Post-Production
Editing:
The editing workflow involved using LogicPro for sound design and Adobe Premiere Pro for video editing. The project also integrated snippets of Taylor Swift’s “Right Where You Left Me” to reflect the emotional atmosphere of the original concept. Additionally, we also added mumble by whirr to enhance the film's overall tone. Once editing was complete, the film was exported as an MP4 file and prepared for linking to the website.
Website Development:
The website was developed through a collaborative GitHub repository. Sabrina began by structuring the website's skeleton, which featured a blurred static background to evoke a sense of mystery and anticipation. The homepage presented two options for users: a brief description of the narrative and a prompt to choose which perspective to follow. This decision at the start allowed the user to engage with the story either from the perspective of the girl in the relationship or the artist observing the scene. (add some challenges in coding, and then add how we fixed it)
A key element of the website is its interactivity: users can switch between the two perspectives at any point during the film, offering a dynamic and engaging experience. This interactive feature allows users to engage with the story from multiple angles, deepening their emotional connection to the characters and enhancing the narrative's impact.

Reflection and Evaluation
Looking back on the entire process, we are extremely proud of how Heartbreaks and Artblocks turned out. While we faced several challenges, from location changes and  conflicting schedules, to technical difficulties and the need to reshoot certain scenes, we managed to overcome each obstacle as a team. Through perseverance, adaptability, and clear communication, we were able to produce a cohesive and emotionally resonant short film. The unexpected location change taught us the importance of being adaptable and creative when things don’t go as planned. Each team member contributed their strengths to the project, from directing and cinematography to sound editing and coding. Finally, the interactive element of the film added an extra layer of engagement that enhanced the overall experience.
Ultimately, Heartbreaks and Artblocks is a reflection of our ability to tell an emotionally compelling story while pushing the boundaries of traditional storytelling by incorporating user interactivity.
